## Input

One of:

- **An update report**: the JSON `npx --yes @oneezy/skills-sync@latest update --json` prints (from `/oneezy-skills`). Its `updated` array holds, per source that moved, `id`, `from` and `to` (each `{ version, commit, ahead }`), `direction` (`upgrade` or `downgrade`) and `changelog`, the upstream `CHANGELOG.md` sections between the two versions (null with `changelogReason` when there is none). A new source (`from` null) has no notes to apply.
- **A range Justin names**: "migrate my repos to Matt 1.3.1" is source `matt-pocock` up to `1.3.1`. Read the notes yourself from the source's `CHANGELOG.md` (`git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none https://github.com/<repo>` at the tag, or `ref`; the repo is in `skills-sync.json`, the nearest `CHANGELOG.md` at or above its `root`). With no lower version, take every section up to the named one: each note is applied only where its old convention is still present, so a wide range changes nothing already migrated.

A downgrade undoes notes: apply them in reverse only when Justin asked for the downgrade by version and the old convention is what that version's skills read; otherwise report the notes and change nothing.

## Do

1. **Extract the notes.** From the changelog text keep only what asks something of a consumer: sections or entries saying breaking, migration, rename, removed, "if you have an existing …", or a file or folder convention the skills read or write. Ignore entries that only change a skill's own wording. No such note: report `no migration notes for <source> <from> → <to>; nothing changed` and stop.
2. **Match a recipe.** `../MIGRATIONS.md` in the skill folder holds every migration already worked out, keyed by source and version. A note with no recipe: write one there in the same shape (what to find, what to change, what to leave alone), then use it; it lands with the skills repo's change.
3. **Check each repo.** For every repo in the table below, look for the recipe's old convention (its `find`). Work in a fresh clone of the repo's base branch in a temporary folder, never in a checkout someone is working in. A repo where nothing matches is `no change`.
4. **Change and land.** In each repo that matches, apply the recipe on one branch, run the repo's own fast checks (its AGENTS.md names them), commit with a conventional subject naming the source and version (`docs: GLOSSARY.md replaces CONTEXT.md (matt-pocock 1.3.0)`), and land it the repo's way:

| Repo | Base | Lands by |
|---|---|---|
| `oneezy/skills` | `dev` | push `land/migrate-<slug>`; `.github/workflows/land.yml` squashes it into `dev`, promotes `main` and releases (run `npx --yes @oneezy/skills-sync@latest build --repo .` and `check --repo .` first) |
| `oneezy/brain` | `dev` | a ready pull request; its automerge workflow merges it on green |
| `oneezy/tools` | `dev` | a ready pull request; its automerge workflow merges it on green |
| `oneezy/ai-workflow` | `main` | a ready pull request; its automerge workflow merges it on green |
| `layerdbiz/tridentcubed` | its AGENTS.md says | a ready pull request to that base |

A pull request body says which upstream note it applies and links the source's changelog. A change under `.github/` never goes through `land/*` (the workflow refuses it) and never relies on automerge (which skips it): open the pull request and say it waits on Justin's merge. A repo this session cannot reach (not cloned, not in scope, push refused) is reported as `not reached` with the change it needs, so another session can run it.

## Report

One line per repo, in the table's order: `<repo>: <what changed>, <PR link or land/... branch>`, `no change`, or `not reached (<why>); needs <change>`. When every repo is `no change`, the report is the single line `<source> <from> → <to>: nothing to migrate`. Then one line per note left unapplied, with why.
