# Portable capability contract

Before using a dependency, load this contract and only the current host adapter (`chatgpt.md`, `claude.md` or `codex.md` beside this file). Consult `catalog.json` for names, dependencies and evidence. These are generated copies of the maintained `docs/agents/capabilities/` source in oneezy/skills.

1. Resolve the requested operation, destination and existing source first. Load the actual selected dependency’s SKILL.md and its route-required references through the host’s skill reader/Skill tool or verified installed path. A catalog entry, package, loaded instruction, exposed tool, authenticated account and successful operation are separate facts.
2. Discover current tool schemas through the host’s advertised discovery route, then call the supported tool for the authorized operation. Do not construct a universal @, $, slash command or MCP tool name. Preserve user-only invocation and approval boundaries. Estimate, Merge and Remote are explicit-only; a router can recommend them, never automatically chain or reproduce them.
3. Prefer an already authorized native connector/API; use a supported host CLI for local operations. If that route is absent or technically unsupported, try the next documented supported route once, using the same scope. Browser fallback needs the host’s permission and an available supported browser route. Access denial, approval refusal and required human invocation stop that destination; they never trigger another writer or an install. Continue independent destinations and report each result separately.
4. Before a missing dependency claim, use supported discovery. Install/connect only what the user’s authorized task requires; reuse existing installations. Loading or mentioning a creator/management skill is preparation. Completion requires executing its supported action and verifying the returned identity, version, source and affected behavior.
5. Keep authoring, packaging, local links, installation, cloud upload, loading and execution distinct. Source-only/review/no-publication scope ends at the verified source/package. Default sync neither uploads a cloud plugin nor installs every dependency. Do not change sharing, permissions, schedules or unrelated plugins.

## Brain capture

Brain owns connector invocation for capture; briefs call Brain with their authorized destination, scope and snapshot. They must not implement another capture writer in their prompts. Load Google Drive instructions before registry/file resolution, Google Sheets instructions plus their required live-read/search safety before List/Schema/task ranges, and Google Docs instructions plus route-required references before context Doc work. Read operations use bounded native APIs. Writes follow the actual connector’s preservation/revision/target rules, Brain’s exact-ID checks, serialization and readback; Sheets lacks revision compare-and-swap.

Current task data is only Inbox and Backlog in the registry workbook; Personal and Work are read-only views. Context lives in canonical Docs. Historical Pages/Spaces and GitHub evidence stay historical and are read only when requested/relevant. Load the actual Pages writing skill only for an independently authorized page write. Missing Drive tools or instructions block dependent Brain operations; keep unrelated destinations moving.

## Maintenance

Recheck the adapter on host/version or management API changes. Record dated evidence and honest unknowns in catalog.json; do not put credentials, private connection IDs or private Brain resource IDs here. Update the source once, run `node scripts/oneezy-capabilities.mjs --write`, its tests, canonical build/check, then review. Never hand-edit generated installed copies.
